# wing-segmentation

In order to facilitate further analyses on mimicry in butterfly species, we set up a preproccesing pipeline to standardize variation across images the Jiggins-Meier and OM_STRI dataset (Owen's).

Segmentation pipeline to segment components from butterfly images:
- wings (right forewing, right hindwing, left forewing, left hindwing) 
- ruler
- label
- color palette
